update the State to have the dropdown values rather than a input text.
make sure the state is selected from the database record.

Add a create page that will add a new record to the database.

Please add java style doc comments in all of the following classes.
AddressBook.php
Passcode.php

Hint: when doing the create(insert) feature, make sure to remove
all references of ID, since the MySQL database will take of that for
you.
